# Demo

This is a demo for [Feed2Pages](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/feed2pages), a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based Blogroll generator and RSS discovery tool.

The generated content is rendered as three main components:

* [Following](following/) - A list of the RSS feeds you're subscribed to
* [Reading](reading/) - A list of recent posts from your RSS feeds
* [Discover](discover/) - RSS feeds recommended by the RSS feeds you follow

The tool is backed by [Feed2Pages-action](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/feed2pages-action), a Golang GitHub Actions utility that collects the required information.

Check out [the repo](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/feed2pages) to get started.

The source code for this demo site is at [Feed2Pages-PaperMod](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/feed2pages-papermod), and shows how the generated content looks with the popular [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) Hugo Theme.
